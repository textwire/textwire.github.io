## If Statement
You can use if statements to conditionally render content. You can construct `@if` statement using the `@if`, `@elseif`, `@else` and `@end` directives.
Here is an example of using if statements:

```textwire
@if(name == "Anna")
    <p>Her name is Anna</p>
@end
```

You can also use `else` and `elseif` statements:

```textwire
@if(x == 1)
    <p>x is 1</p>
@elseif(x == 2)
    <p>x is 2</p>
@else
    <p>x is not 1 and 2</p>
@end
```

## For Loop
You can use regular for loops to iterate over an array or a range of numbers.

This is a basic for loop that you can use. It has a declaration, condition and post statement. `for <declaration>; <condition>; <post>`. They are all optional. Here is an example of using for loop:

```textwire
{{ names = ["Ann", "Serhii"] }}

@for(i = 0; i < names.len(); i++)
    <p>{{ names[i] }}</p>
@else
    <p>No names</p>
@end
```

:::

#### Example
```textwire
{{ names = ["Ann", "Serhii", "Vladimir"] }}

<ul>
    @for(i = 0; i < names.len(); i++)
        @continueIf(names[i] == "Serhii")
        <li>{{ names[i] }}</li>
    @end
</ul>
```

## Each Loop
Each statement is a special for loop that you can use to iterate over an array. It has a declaration and an array. `@each(<declaration> in <array>)`. Here is an example of using each loop:

```textwire
{{ names = ["Ann", "Serhii"] }}

@each(name in names)
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
@end
```

:::info Read More about Loops

:::

## Variable Declaration
You can assign and declare variables by using the `=` operator. Here is an example of declaring variables:

```textwire
{{ x = 5 }}
{{ x = 10 }}
```

You cannot assign values to variables that have a different type. For example, you cannot do `{{ x = "Hello"; x = 3 }}` because `x` is a string and then you are trying to assign an integer to it. In Textwire, you don't need to declare type of a variable, it will be automatically inferred from the value that you assign to it.

:::info Declaration has no output
Variable declaration statements are not expressions! They don't return any value and can't be used inside of other expressions. Therefore, they don't print anything to the output.
:::

## Use Statement
`@use` statements allow you to specify a layout file that will be used to render the current template. This feature is useful for creating reusable layouts that can be applied to multiple templates.

Here is an example of using use statement:

```textwire
@use("layouts/main")
```

Or, you can use a path alias like this:

```textwire
@use("~main")
```

:::info Use statement Path alias
If your layouts are located in the `layouts` directory, you can use the `~` alias to reference them. For example, `@use("~main")` instead of `@use("layouts/main")`. Behind the scenes, the `~` alias will be replaced with `layouts/`.
:::

The `@use` statement accepts a string literal as its argument. This string literal should specify the path to the layout file relative to the [`TemplateDir`](/docs/v2/guides/configurations#setting-configurations) parameter defined in the configuration. For example, if [`TemplateDir`](/docs/v2/guides/configurations#setting-configurations) is set to `"src/templates"` and you have `layouts` directory in there, you can use the layout statement like `@use("layouts/main")`, and it will look for the layout file at `"src/templates/layouts/main.tw"`.

:::info Understanding the @use Directive
When you use the `@use` directive, only the content inside [`@insert`](#insert-statement) directives will be rendered; the rest of the file's content will be ignored. This is because the `@use` directive applies a layout file instead of rendering the current file directly. During this process, all placeholders reserved in the layout file are populated with the content specified within your [`@insert`](#insert-statement) directives.
:::

## Insert Statement
The `@insert` statement lets you inject content into placeholders defined by the [`@reserve`](#reserve-statement) statement in your layout file. This feature enables flexible template structuring and reusability.

Below is an example demonstrating two scenarios for the `@insert` statement with a content body and without:

```textwire title="home.tw"
@use("layouts/main")

<!-- Without a content body -->
@insert("title", "Home page")

<!-- With a content body -->
@insert("content")
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a home page.</p>
@end
```

The `@insert` statement is optional and accepts two arguments: the name of the reserved placeholder and the optional content to be injected into that placeholder.

All `@insert` statements are evaluated within the layout file, where they are matched to placeholders defined by the [`@reserve`](#reserve-statement) statement.

:::info Important Notes
- Defining an `@insert` for a placeholder that is not declared in the layout file using [`@reserve`](#reserve-statement) will result in an error.
- You cannot define multiple `@insert` statements with the same name in a single file.
:::

## Reserve Statement
When defining a layout file for your template, you can reserve placeholders for dynamic content. These placeholders can be used for elements such as the title, content, sidebar, footer, and more. Below is an example of how to use the `@reserve` statement:

```textwire title="layouts/main.tw"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>@reserve("title")</title>
</head>
<body>
    @reserve("content")
</body>
</html>
```

:::info Pass Variables to the Layout
All variables passed to the template file are also available in the layout file. This means you can replace `@reserve("title")` with `{{ title }}` and define the `title` variable in each template file. In other words, variables available in the template file can be seamlessly used within the layout file.
:::

The `@reserve` statement accepts a single argument: the name of the reserved placeholder. This name will be used in the [`@insert`](#insert-statement) statement to insert content into the corresponding placeholder.

## Component
One of the best features of Textwire is the ability to use components. You can create a directory `components` in your templates and put all your components there. Then you can use the `@component` directive to include a component in your template. Let's see a simple example of a component:

### Example of a Component
```textwire title="components/post-card.tw"
<div class="post">
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
</div>
```

### Example of Using a Template
```textwire title="home.tw"
<div class="posts">
    @each(post in posts)
        @component("components/post-card", { post })
    @end
</div>
```

:::info Component path alias
If your components are located in the `components` directory, you can use the `~` alias to reference them. For example, `@component("~post-card", { post })` instead of `@component("components/post-card", { post })`. Behind the scenes, the `~` alias will be replaced with `components/`.
:::

The first argument of the `@component` directive is a path to the component file relative to the `TemplateDir` parameter that you set in the config.

The second optional argument is a [Textwire object](/docs/v2/language-elements/literals#object) that you want to pass to the component. Here is another example of using a component with a second argument:

```textwire title="home.tw"
<ul>
    @each(book in books)
        @component("parts/book", { completed: book.completed })
    @end
</ul>
```

You can also use slots in components to pass content to the component. Read about slots in the next section.

## Component Slots
Component slots are a common feature in many template languages and frameworks. Textwire supports both named and default slots, allowing you to pass content into components flexibly.

There are two types of slots in Textwire: default slots and named slots.

- **Default Slots**: Use the `@slot` directive to define and pass content to a default slot.
- **Named Slots**: Use the `@slot("slot-name")` directive to define and pass content to a named slot.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use slots in a component. Consider this component:

```textwire title="components/book.tw"
<div class="book">
    @slot

    <h1>{{ book.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ book.description }}</p>

    @slot('footer')
</div>
```

We can now use `book.tw` component in our Textwire files like this:

```textwire title="home.tw"
@each(book in books)
    @component("~book", { book })
        @slot
            <img src="{{ book.image }}" alt="{{ book.title }}">
        @end

        @slot('footer')
            <small>published by {{ book.author }}</small>
            <button>Read more</button>
        @end
    @end
@end
```

In this example, both default and named slots are used within a single component. You can include as many slots as needed in a single component, provided that all named slots have unique names.

:::info Important Note
Defining multiple slots with the same name, or defining 2 default slots in a single component will result in an error.

## Dump Directive
The `@dump` directive will feel familiar to [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) users. It is primarily used for debugging purposes. This directive outputs the value of variables, [objects](/docs/v2/language-elements/literals#object), [arrays](/docs/v2/language-elements/literals#array), [strings](/docs/v2/language-elements/literals#string) and other data types to the screen.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `@dump` directive:

```textwire
{{ names = ["John", "Jane", "Jack", "Jill"] }}

@dump(names)
```

The output would look like something like this:

<img src="/img/dump-names.png" title="Dump output in Textwire" width="150" />

### Works with Different Types
Similarly, you can print objects and other types of data:

```textwire
<h1>This is my title</h1>

@dump({
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    admin: false,
    hobbies: ["reading", "coding"],
})

<p>Some content</p>
```

<img src="/img/dump-object.png" title="Dump object in Textwire" width="400" />

### Dump Multiple Objects
`@dump` directive can accept an endless amount arguments at once:

```textwire
{{ meta = [1, 2.23, true, false, nil] }}
{{ user = { name: "John", age: 25 } }}

@dump(meta, user)
```

<img src="/img/dump-multiple.png" title="Dump multiple object in Textwire" width="300" />

It's an easy and convenient way to debug your templates and see what's going on inside of them.
