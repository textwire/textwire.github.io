# Community & Support

## Meet the Creator

I'm [SerhiiCho](https://serhiicho.com/about-me), and I fell in love with Go in 2019. That's when I started investing my time in the language and noticed something was missing. Other templating systems didn't give me the joy of writing frontend code that I was looking for. Textwire is my answer - one of those small lego bricks that completes the Go ecosystem's templating landscape.

## Support the Project

To help Textwire continue evolving, we need your support. Our goal is $50 per week in total weekly donations to maintain Textwire core, VSCode and Neovim plugins, LSP server, Tree Sitter parser, and documentation. [Donate on Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/textwire/donate) to help us reach this goal.
