It enables you to handle business logic on the backend and pass the processed data to Textwire templates.  Here’s a quick example of what a basic Textwire template looks like:  index.tw &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;My blog&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; @if(age &lt; 18) &lt;p&gt;You are under 18 years old&lt;/p&gt; @end &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   As shown, the syntax is clean and intuitive.

This means you can seamlessly integrate logic into your email templates, markdown files, or any other text-based content.  Additionally, Textwire comes with a VSCode extension that offers syntax highlighting and icons for Textwire files, making template development even more straightforward. Plugin for Neovim is coming soon.    Here are some of the key benefits of using Textwire:  Error handling. Textwire provides detailed error messages with line numbers and file names, making it easier to debug your templatesPerformance. Textwire is fast and has a low memory footprint, making it load pages quickly. The parsing is done at application startup, so there is no overhead during runtimeFlexibility. Textwire allows you to define custom functions and components, giving you the flexibility to create complex templates with easeSecurity. Textwire is designed to be secure by default, preventing code injection attacks when printing user-generated contentSupport. Textwire is constantly being improved and updated.

I cannot overstate the importance of having effective error handling in place when things go wrong. Receiving clear and detailed error messages is crucial for success. Here are the enhancements introduced in version v2.1.0:  🐛 Fixed Bug with Prefix Expression Precedence: Resolved an issue where prefix expressions like {{ -1.abs() }} were not being processed correctly. Previously, the parser evaluated the expression as {{ (-(1.abs())) }}, resulting in an incorrect output of -1. Now, the parser correctly handles the precedence, evaluating it as {{ ((-1).abs()) }}.🧑‍💻 Enhanced Error Handling for Built-in Functions: Improved error messages when an incorrect argument type is passed to a built-in function. Users will now receive clear error messages indicating the type mismatch.🧑‍💻 Enhanced Error Handling for Custom Functions: If a function is called on a type where it doesn’t exist, Textwire now provides a detailed error message specifying that the function is undefined for that type. For example, an error message might read: [Textwire ERROR in /var/www/html/templates/home.tw:3]: function 'some' doesn't exist for type 'STRING'.🧑‍💻 Enhanced Error Handling for Division by Zero: Improved error messages for division-by-zero cases, replacing previous vague messages with more meaningful ones.🧑‍💻 New error page while rendering a template.

They are used to define the structure and behavior of your text files. However, there are some key differences between them:  All directives are statements, but not all statements are directivesDirectives start with the @ symbol, while statements are a general term for parts of code that perform an action and do not return a value  note You can read about statements in the Statements section of the documentation.  For example, {{ x = 5 }} is a statement that assigns the value 5 to the variable x. On the other hand, @use('~main') is a directive and a statement at the same time, as it includes the layout main in the current file and doesn't return a value.

This feature is useful for creating reusable layouts that can be applied to multiple templates.  Here is an example of using use statement:  @use(&quot;layouts/main&quot;)   Use Statement Path Alias If your layouts are located in the layouts directory, you can use the ~ alias to reference them. For example, @use(&quot;~main&quot;) instead of @use(&quot;layouts/main&quot;). Behind the scenes, the ~ alias will be replaced with layouts/.  The @use statement accepts a string literal as its argument. This string literal should specify the path to the layout file relative to the TemplateDir parameter defined in the configuration. For example, if TemplateDir is set to &quot;src/templates&quot; and you have layouts directory in there, you can use the layout statement like @use(&quot;layouts/main&quot;), and it will look for the layout file at &quot;src/templates/layouts/main.tw&quot;.  Understanding the @use Directive When you use the @use directive, only the content inside @insert directives will be rendered; the rest of the file's content will be ignored. This is because the @use directive applies a layout file instead of rendering the current file directly. During this process, all placeholders reserved in the layout file are populated with the content specified within your @insert directives.
