Since Go doesn&#39;t have a simple and easy to use template language, Textwire was created to fill that gap. It is a simple and easy to use language that can be used with any text files.</p><h2 id="how-textwire-parses-text-files" tabindex="-1">How Textwire Parses Text Files? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-textwire-parses-text-files" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How Textwire Parses Text Files?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Textwire has it&#39;s own lexing and parsing engine that is used to parse text files. It reads the text file line by line and converts it into a tree of nodes. Each node represents a part of the text file and can be used to generate the final output.</p><p>All the non-Textwire specific parts of the text file are not parsed as HTML, XML or any other format. They are treated as plain text and are not modified in any way. Even whitespace in your text is preserved in the final output. The only parts that are parsed are the Textwire specific parts, like directives and expressions like:</p><div class="language-textwire vp-adaptive-theme line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">textwire</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light catppuccin-mocha vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-light-font-style:inherit;--shiki-dark:#89B4FA;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic;">{{</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#A6E3A1;"> &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#CBA6F7;">.</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-light-font-style:inherit;--shiki-dark:#89B4FA;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic;">upper()</span><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-light-font-style:inherit;--shiki-dark:#89B4FA;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic;"> }}</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>That&#39;s why Textwire is fast and efficient, as it only parses the parts that are necessary and leaves the rest as is.</p><h2 id="is-textwire-a-templating-engine" tabindex="-1">Is Textwire a Templating Engine? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-textwire-a-templating-engine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Textwire a Templating Engine?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Textwire is not exactly a templating engine. It is a Domain-specific language (DSL) written in Go. It is designed to be used with Go programs to provide elegant and easy to use syntax for working with front-end. It&#39;s a good alternative to other templating engines for Go since it&#39;s performant and optimized.</p><h2 id="why-it-s-best-to-prevent-visitors-of-your-site-from-seeing-the-result-of-the-function-output-when-an-error-occurs" tabindex="-1">Why It&#39;s Best to Prevent Visitors of Your Site From Seeing the Result of the Function Output When an Error Occurs? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-it-s-best-to-prevent-visitors-of-your-site-from-seeing-the-result-of-the-function-output-when-an-error-occurs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why It&#39;s Best to Prevent Visitors of Your Site From Seeing the Result of the Function Output When an Error Occurs?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When an error occurs in your function, the output may be incorrect or misleading. Displaying this faulty output to users can result in confusing information, broken layouts, or even unintentionally exposing sensitive data.</p><p>For example, a function might return partial or incorrect data due to an error in the logic or wrong inputs. If this faulty output is displayed to your site’s visitors, it could negatively impact the user experience by showing inaccurate information or broken page elements.</p><p>Moreover, displaying incorrect output can also pose security risks, as it might reveal unintended details about the internal workings of your system, or expose raw data that wasn’t meant to be shown. By hiding incorrect output when an error occurs, you ensure that visitors only see validated, correct content, maintaining both the integrity of your site’s data and the trustworthiness of your user experience.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-directives-and-statements-in-textwire" tabindex="-1">What is the Difference Between Directives and Statements in Textwire? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-directives-and-statements-in-textwire" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the Difference Between Directives and Statements in Textwire?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Directives and statements are the core of Textwire language.
