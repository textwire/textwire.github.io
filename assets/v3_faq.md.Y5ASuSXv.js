Unlike other Go templating engines I&#39;ve used, Textwire provides the joy and flexibility needed for frontend development. It is a simple and stable language that should be used for your app. See how to <a href="/v3/get-started">Get Started</a> with Textwire.</p><h2 id="how-does-textwire-parse-files" tabindex="-1">How Does Textwire Parse Files? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-textwire-parse-files" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How Does Textwire Parse Files?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Textwire has its own unique chain of turning your text files into final output. We do it in 4 steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Tokenizing</strong> your Textwire template into tokens.</li><li><strong>Parsing</strong> turns tokens into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AST</a> nodes.</li><li><strong>Linking</strong> connects related AST nodes to each other.</li><li><strong>Evaluating</strong> turns connected AST nodes into final text output.</li></ol><p>All non-Textwire-specific parts of the text file are treated as plain text and are not parsed as HTML, XML, or any other format. They remain unmodified in the final output, including whitespace preservation. Only Textwire-specific parts are processed:</p><div class="language-textwire vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">textwire</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light catppuccin-mocha vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#94E2D5;">&lt;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#22863A;--shiki-dark:#89B4FA;">h1</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#94E2D5;">&gt;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#CDD6F4;">Textwire seems cool</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#94E2D5;">&lt;/</span><span style="--shiki-light:#22863A;--shiki-dark:#89B4FA;">h1</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#94E2D5;">&gt;</span></span>

It is a Domain-specific language (DSL) written in Go. It is designed to be used with Go programs to provide elegant and easy-to-use syntax for working with frontend. It&#39;s a good alternative to other templating engines for Go since it&#39;s performant and optimized.</p><h2 id="prevent-visitors-from-seeing-error" tabindex="-1">Prevent Visitors from Seeing Error <a class="header-anchor" href="#prevent-visitors-from-seeing-error" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prevent Visitors from Seeing Error&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When an error occurs in your function, the output may be incorrect or misleading.
